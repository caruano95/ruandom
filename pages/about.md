My name is Carlos Ruano. I’m a Software Engineer with extensive experience testing software applications, strong troubleshooting and analytical skills and passion for coding and building products.

## Work Experience

### Ohalo
### Software Engineer IV (Jan 2021 to now)
Ohalo is a high-growth startup in the space of unstructured data discovery and classification, and I joined as the very first engineer in charge of quality assurance. When I first started in the company, the engineering org was a 12-person team including one of the founders, and we've quickly tripled the size of the team while at the same time improving all aspects of our product. Coming from big corporations meant that it was a big change in scenery for me, but also meant that I had a good idea of the direction we should take to improve. One of the very first things I did was cement the idea that QA was not a last-step quality check but rather all the improvements to the process itself which lead to a better quality product. 


### Rappi
### QA Automation Engineer (May 2021 to Aug 2021.)
I worked for a brief period as a QA Automation Engineer at Rappi, a delivery startup and one of the fastest growing companies in LATAM. I was part of a new team tasked with automating the regression testing process for various verticals in the company, working with both Android and iOS. I mostly worked on Appium scripts as well as helped with the development of the testing framework that was used company-wide.


### PayPal
### Software Engineer 2, QA (Sept 2018 to Apr 2021)
I joined PayPal in 2018 as a Software Engineer for the QA department. I worked in a couple of projects but the one dearest to me was with Xoom, as part of the "Partnerships" team, which is at the core of its money transfer business. This team is responsible for a disbursement platform that integrates to many third-party systems through REST, SOAP and file-based APIs.
In specific, my role involved code review, manual tests, test automation and releases to the different environments. Many of the changes we implemented were to support the migration from an on-premises infrastructure to cloud, as well as integrating new partners into our network.
Another big part of my job, was to make improvements to the release process itself by automating tasks like generating release notes, migrating Jenkins pipelines to code, and creating tools to aid in testing the apps.

### Xik'
### Software Engineer (Nov 2015 to Aug 2018)
Contracted through Xik’, I worked as the Quality Assurance Lead of the National Geographic video streaming app for Latin America. I was responsible for the project automated and manual regression tests, for both front end of the app (iOS and Android) and the backend services.
