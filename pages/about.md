## Work Experience

### Ohalo
### Software Engineer IV (Jan 2021 to now)
In the beginning of 2022, I got the opportunity to join Ohalo, a very exciting startup that is leading the industry in classification of unstructured data. I joined the company as the first engineer in charge of quality assurance. Since then, I've been working on establishing the QA processes for the company as well as enabling everyone in the organization to contribute to and take shared responsibility for the quality of our products.


### Rappi
### QA Automation Engineer (May 2021 to Aug 2021.)
I worked for a brief period as a QA Automation Engineer at Rappi, a delivery startup and one of the fastest growing companies in LATAM. I was part of a new team tasked with automating the regression testing process for various verticals in the company, working with both Android and iOS. I mostly worked on Appium scripts as well as helped with the development of the testing framework that was used company-wide.


### PayPal
### Software Engineer 2, QA (Sept 2018 to Apr 2021)
I joined PayPal in 2018 as a Software Engineer for the QA department. I worked in a couple of projects but the one dearest to me was with Xoom, as part of the "Partnerships" team, which is at the core of its money transfer business. This team is responsible for a disbursement platform that integrates to many third-party systems through REST, SOAP and file-based APIs.
In specific, my role involved code review, manual tests, test automation and releases to the different environments. Many of the changes we implemented were to support the migration from an on-premises infrastructure to cloud, as well as integrating new partners into our network.
Another big part of my job, was to make improvements to the release process itself by automating tasks like generating release notes, migrating Jenkins pipelines to code, and creating tools to aid in testing the apps.

### Xik'
### Software Engineer (Nov 2015 to Aug 2018)
Contracted through Xik’, I worked as the Quality Assurance Lead of the National Geographic video streaming app for Latin America. I was responsible for the project automated and manual regression tests, for both front end of the app (iOS and Android) and the backend services.
